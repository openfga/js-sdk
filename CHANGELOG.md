# Changelog


## [Unreleased](https://github.com/openfga/js-sdk/compare/v0.9.0...HEAD)

## v0.9.0

### [v0.9.0](https://github.com/openfga/js-sdk/compare/v0.8.1...v0.9.0) (2025-06-03)

- feat: support client assertion for client credentials authentication (#228)

## v0.8.1

### [v0.8.1](https://github.com/openfga/js-sdk/compare/v0.8.0...v0.8.1) (2025-04-24)

- fix: change check for Node.js environment to fix issue where `process.title` cannot be read (#222)

## v0.8.0

### [0.8.0](https://github.com/openfga/js-sdk/compare/v0.7.0...v0.8.0) (2025-01-14)

- feat!: add support for server-side `BatchCheck` method. This is a more efficient way to check on multiple tuples than calling the existing client-side `BatchCheck`. Using this method requires an OpenFGA [v1.8.0+](https://github.com/openfga/openfga/releases/tag/v1.8.0) server.
    - The existing `BatchCheck` method has been renamed to `clientBatchCheck` and it now bundles the results in a field called `result` instead of `responses`.
    - The existing `BatchCheckResponse` has been renamed to `ClientBatchCheckResponse`.
- feat: add support for  startTime` parameter in `ReadChanges` endpoint
- feat: support contextual tuples and context in assertions
- feat: support contextual tuples in Expand
- fix: error correctly if apiUrl is not provided - thanks @Waheedsys (#161)
- fix: use provided axios instance in credentials refresh - thanks @Siddhant-K-code (#193)
- fix!: The minimum node version required by this SDK is now v16.15.0
- chore(docs): various cleanup and improvements - thanks @tmsagarofficial (#164), @vil02 (https://github.com/openfga/sdk-generator/pull/424, https://github.com/openfga/sdk-generator/pull/422), @sccalabr (https://github.com/openfga/sdk-generator/pull/433)

BREAKING CHANGES:
- The minimum node version required by this SDK is now v16.15.0
- Usage of the existing `batchCheck` method should now use the `clientBatchCheck` method. The existing `BatchCheckResponse` has been renamed to `ClientBatchCheckResponse` and it now bundles the results in a field called `result` instead of `responses`.

    This is only a breaking change on the SDK, not the API. It was changed to conform to the proto changes in [openfga/api](https://github.com/openfga/api/pull/27).
    It makes the type name more consistent and less confusing (normally people would incorrectly assume TypeDefinitions = TypeDefinition[]).
- chore(deps): upgrade dependencies

## v0.0.2

### [0.0.2](https://github.com/openfga/js-sdk/compare/v0.0.1...v0.0.2) (2022-08-15)

Support for [ListObjects API]](https://openfga.dev/api/service#/Relationship%20Queries/ListObjects)

You call the API and receive the list of object ids from a particular type that the user has a certain relation with.

For example, to find the list of documents that Anne can read:

```javascript
const response = await openFgaApi.listObjects({
  user: "anne",
  relation: "can_read",
  type: "document"
});

// response.object_ids = ["roadmap"]
```
